Who is MrJoshuaP?
-----------------
I'm just a technologist that lives in the midwest, you know, the state that is
round on the ends and hi in the middle?  For fun, I play Call of Duty: Zombies,
if you play, look me up on XBox Live: MrJoshuaP.

After a few years working with technology, primarily with Unix based systems
from organizations named after large celestrial bodies, I decided to start
working with a variety of companies to secure and migrate workloads to Linux.

blah blah blah blah -- skip forward another indeterminate amount of time

Now, I find myself a Solutions Architect with Red Hat helping lots of other
companies forge a path to success using open source technologies.  As a member
of the Identity Managment Subject Matter Expert group, I have a passion for
security.
